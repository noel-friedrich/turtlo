## About
Turtlo is a cute animal that follows your cursor on any website you visit. Turtlo also sometimes does some stuff when he is bored - like walking around, spinning around and generally being very cute.

Of course, Turtlo respects the fact that there may be some website where you don't need a turtle crawling around. That's why you can enable/disable Turtlo on websites individually!

Turtlo single use is to make the web a happier place. With Turtlo, every boring website becomes fun! Download Turtlo now and start smiling!
